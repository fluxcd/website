🤝 | **Flux provides GitOps for both apps and infrastructure** | Flux and Flagger deploy apps with canaries, feature flags, and A/B rollouts. Flux can also manage any Kubernetes resource. Infrastructure and workload dependency management is built in.
🤖 | **Just push to Git and Flux does the rest** | Flux enables application deployment (CD) and (with the help of Flagger) progressive delivery (PD) through automatic reconciliation. Flux can even push back to Git for you with automated container image updates to Git (image scanning and patching).
🔩 | **Flux works with your existing tools** | Flux works with your Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, can even use s3-compatible buckets as a source), all major container registries, and all CI workflow providers.
☸️ | **Flux works with any Kubernetes and all common Kubernetes tooling** | Kustomize, Helm, RBAC, and policy-driven validation (OPA, Kyverno, admission controllers) so it simply falls into place.
🤹 | **Flux does Multi-Tenancy (and “Multi-everything”)** | Flux uses true Kubernetes RBAC via impersonation and supports multiple Git repositories. Multi-cluster infrastructure and apps work out of the box with Cluster API: Flux can use one Kubernetes cluster to manage apps in either the same or other clusters, spin up additional clusters themselves, and manage clusters including lifecycle and fleets.
📞 | **Flux alerts and notifies** | Flux provides health assessments, alerting to external systems, and external events handling. Just “git push”, and get notified on Slack and [other chat systems](/docs/components/notification/provider/).
💖 | **Flux has a lovely community that is very easy to work with!** | We welcome contributors of any kind. The components of Flux are on Kubernetes core controller-runtime, so anyone can contribute and its functionality can be extended very easily.

<h2 class="section-label">GitOps at your fingertips</h2>

Flux is a collection of tools for keeping <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> clusters
in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to configuration
when there is new code to deploy.

{{< /blocks/lead >}}

{{< blocks/section type="features" color="white" >}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fab fa-git-square fa-3x" title="Declarative" height="auto" color="blue" %}}
Describe the entire desired state of your system in [Git](https://git-scm.com). This includes apps, configuration,
dashboards, monitoring, and everything else.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-robot fa-3x" title="Automated" height="auto" color="blue" %}}
Use [YAML](https://yaml.org) to enforce conformance to the declared system. You don't need to run
[`kubectl`](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/) because all changes are synced automatically.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-code fa-3x" title="Auditable" height="auto" color="blue" %}}
Everything is controlled through pull requests. Your Git history provides a sequence of transactions, allowing you to
recover state from any snapshot.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-drafting-compass fa-3x" title="Designed for Kubernetes" height="auto" color="blue" %}}
Declaratively configurable using Custom Resources, state reports in the
[object's status](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#object-spec-and-status)
and via [Kubernetes Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-application-introspection/),
and integrations with Kubernetes RBAC
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-box-open fa-3x" title="Out-of-the-box integrations" height="auto" color="blue" %}}
Support for e.g. [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io), [Helm](https://helm.sh); GitHub, GitLab, Harbor and custom
webhooks; notifications to most team communication platforms; and many more.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-cube fa-3x" title="Extensible" height="auto" color="blue" %}}
Easily create a continuous delivery solution with only the components you need, or use the [GitOps Toolkit](#gitops-toolkit)
to extend Flux.

We owe our success and good reputation as GitOps project to Flux and Helm Operator. They are the v1 iteration of our project and currently in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux/issues/3320).

We **strongly advise** everyone to familiarise themselves with the latest version of Flux and [start the process of migrating](/docs/migration/).
