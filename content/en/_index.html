title: Flux - the GitOps family of projects
description: > 
  Flux is a set of continuous and progressive delivery solutions for Kubernetes, and they are open and extensible. 
  
  The APIs of Flux are stable now.
benefits:
  - title: GitOps for apps and infrastructure
    icon: fas fa-handshake
    description: >
      Flux and [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger) deploy apps with canaries, feature flags,
      and A/B rollouts. Flux can also manage any Kubernetes resource. Infrastructure and workload
      dependency management is built in.
  - title: Declarative & Automated
    icon: fab fa-git-square
    description: >
      Describe the entire desired state of your system in [Git](https://git-scm.com).
      This includes apps, configuration, dashboards, monitoring, and everything else.
      Use [YAML](https://yaml.org) to enforce conformance to the declared system.
      You don't need to run [kubectl](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io) because all
      changes are synced automatically.
  - title: Auditable
    icon: fas fa-code
    description: >
      Everything is controlled through pull requests. Your Git history provides a sequence of
      transactions, allowing you to recover state from any snapshot.
features:
  - title: Push to Git and Flux does the rest
    icon: fas fa-robot
    description: >
      Flux enables application deployment (CD) and (with the help of
      [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger)) progressive delivery (PD) through automatic
      reconciliation. Flux can even push back to Git for you with automated container image updates
      to Git (image scanning and patching).
  - title: Works with your existing tools
    icon: fas fa-wrench
    description: >
      Flux works with your Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, can even use s3-compatible buckets
      as a source), all major container registries, fully integrates [with
      OCI](/flux/cheatsheets/oci-artifacts) and all CI workflow providers.
  - title: Designed with security in mind
    icon: fas fa-lock
    description: >
      Pull vs. Push, least amount of privileges, adherence to Kubernetes security policies and
      tight integration with security tools and best-practices. Read more about [our security
      considerations](/flux/security).
  - title: Does Multi-Tenancy (and “Multi-everything”)
    icon: fas fa-people-roof
    description: >
      Flux uses true Kubernetes RBAC via impersonation and supports multiple Git repositories.
      Multi-cluster infrastructure and apps work out of the box with Cluster API: Flux can use
      one Kubernetes cluster to manage apps in either the same or other clusters, spin up
      additional clusters themselves, and manage clusters including lifecycle and fleets.
  - title: Works with any Kubernetes and all common tooling
    icon: fas fa-dharmachakra
    description: >
      Support for e.g. [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io), [Helm](https://helm.sh); GitHub, GitLab, Harbor
      and custom webhooks; notifications on Slack and [other chat
      systems](/flux/components/notification/provider/); RBAC, and policy-driven validation (OPA, Kyverno,
      admission controllers).
  - title: Dashboards love Flux
    icon: fas fa-wand-magic-sparkles
    description: >
      No matter if you use one of [the Flux UIs](/ecosystem/#flux-uis--guis) or a hosted cloud offering from
      your cloud vendor, Flux has a thriving ecosystem of integrations and products built on top of it and
      all have great dashboards for you.
