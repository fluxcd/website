As the Flux family of projects and its communities are growing, we
strive to inform you each month about what has already landed, new
possibilities which are available for integration, and where you can get
involved. Read our [last update here](/blog/2022/05/april-2022-update/).

It's the beginning of June 2022 - let's recap together what happened in
May - it has been a lot!

## News in the Flux family

### Flux v0.30 release

The latest Flux release is the v0.30 release series. It comes with new
features and improvements. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best
experience. Note:
[v0.29.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.29.0)
included breaking changes.

:rocket: Features and improvements

- Support for disabling remote bases in Kustomize overlays: this
  release adds support to the `kustomize-controller` for disallowing
  remote bases in Kustomize overlays using `--no-remote-bases=true`
  (`default: false`). When this flag is enabled on the controller, all
  resources must refer to local files included in the Source
  Artifact, meaning only the Flux Sources can affect the
  cluster-state. Users are advised to enable it on production
  systems for security and performance reasons.
- Support for defining a `KubeConfig` Secret data key: both
  `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` resources do now accept a
  `.spec.kubeConfig.SecretRef.key` definition. When the value is
  specified, the `KubeConfig` JSON is retrieved from this data key in
  the referred Secret, instead of the defaults (value or
  `value.yaml`).
- Support for defining a `ServiceAccountName` in `ImageRepository`
  objects: the `ImageRepository` object does now accept a
  `.spec.serviceAccountName` definition. When specified, the image
  pull secrets attached to the ServiceAccount are used to
  authenticate towards the registry.

### 🔒 Flux Security announcement

We published three CVEs today which affect Flux versions earlier than
v0.29.0. We recommend updating your Flux system at your earliest
convenience.

More information on the advisories can be found in our [security policy
page](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/policy#advisories).

To get some additional background on the advisories and what steps we
are taking to make Flux more secure, check out our [blog post about the
advisories](/blog/2022/05/may-2022-security-announcement/)
as well.

### Upcoming Flux Release

The next Flux release is just a few days out. Here is in a nutshell what you can look forward to - but there’ll be more!

- OCI Helm chart support as described in [RFC-0002](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/tree/main/rfcs/0002-helm-oci) will become available. But at time of writing, has two caveats:
  - Chart dependencies from OCI repositories are not supported. [#722](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/issues/722)
  - Custom CA certificates are not supported. [#723](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/issues/723)
- `GitRepository` reconciliation will be more efficient when checking out repositories using branches or tags by added support for no-op clones.
- The `libgit2` managed transport will be moved out of experimental mode, and is the new default.

Make sure you watch our Slack and Twitter to get the update. [Give us a star](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) and watch for releases maybe as well.

### Flagger 1.21.0 brings lots of improvements

[This release](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger/releases/tag/v1.21.0)
comes with an option to disable cross-namespace references to Kubernetes
custom resources such as `AlertProviders` and `MetricProviders`. When
running Flagger on multi-tenant environments it is advised to set the
`-no-cross-namespace-refs=true` flag.

In addition, this version enables Flagger to target Istio and Kuma
multi-cluster setups. When installing Flagger with Helm, the service
mesh control plane `kubeconfig` secret can be specified using `--set
controlplane.kubeconfig.secretName`.

### Flux Ecosystem

We have a lot of updates from the Flux Ecosystem and love how everything
keeps on growing! If you are interested in more news from Flux
integration, make sure you register for [GitOps
Days](https://www.gitopsdays.com/) at 8-9 June - a lot of
engineers and companies will be talking about their work and how you can
benefit from it.

#### Flux Subsystem for Argo

[Flux Subsystem for Argo](https://github.com/flux-subsystem-argo/flamingo)
was upgraded to support Argo CD v2.2.9, and welcomed Kingdon Barrett as
a new maintainer for the project.

#### Terraform-controller

[terraform-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller) v0.9.5
was released which contains new features such as support for Runner Pod's
metadata, support environment variables for Runner Pod so that you can set
proxy for Terraform binary with `HTTPS_PROXY` for example. This release
also included many bug fixes.

#### Weave GitOps

The [Weave GitOps](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops) team released
v0.8.1 for Weave GitOps. This release is an iteration on top of our prior
release.  We have fixed a lot of bugs and made UI enhancements based on
feedback from the community. For example, you are able to reconcile Flux
objects directly from the UI. We have a lot of great features planned
over the next couple months. Please do not hesitate to drop in some
feature requests.

#### New additions to the Flux Ecosystem

We are thrilled to see the Flux Ecosystem growing on a continuous basis.
The most recent additions to our [Flux Ecosystem page](/ecosystem/) are
`flux-kluctl-controller` and `gardener-extension-shoot-flux`.

[kluctl/flux-kluctl-controller](https://github.com/kluctl/flux-kluctl-controller)
is a Flux controller for managing [Kluctl](https://kluctl.io) deployments.
Its website explains kluctl as follows

> *Kluctl is the missing glue to put together large Kubernetes
> deployments.*
>
> *It allows you to declare and manage small, large, simple and/or
> complex multi-env and multi-cluster deployments.*
>
> *Kluctl does not have cluster-side dependencies and works out of the
> box.*

[23technologies/gardener-extension-shoot-flux](https://github.com/23technologies/gardener-extension-shoot-flux) is a new integration with Flux. Gardener
implements the automated management and operation of Kubernetes clusters
as a service. With this extension fresh clusters will be reconciled to
the state defined in the Git repository by the Flux controller.

## Recent & Upcoming Events

It's important to keep you up to date with new features and developments
in Flux and provide simple ways to see our work in action and chat with
our engineers.

### Recent Events (ICYMI) 📺

We feel blessed to have such a big community of users, contributors and
integrators and so many are happy to talk about their experiences. In
May here are a couple of talks we would like to highlight.

Last month was all about KubeCon and there were lots of great sessions
we enjoyed and recommend watching. It might be best if you just head to
our [KubeCon Re-Cap blog post](/blog/2022/05/kubecon-eu-2022-wrap-up/)
and take it from there!

Here is a list of additional videos and topics we really enjoyed -
please let us know if we missed anything of interest and we will make
sure to mention it in the next post!

event](https://www.gitopsdays.com/) (8-9 June).

### Upcoming Events 📆

We are happy to announce that we have a number of events coming up in
June - tune in to learn more about Flux and GitOps best practices, get
to know the team and join our community.

### Flux Bug Scrub

Our Flux Bug Scrubs still are happening on a weekly basis and remain one
of the best ways to get involved in Flux. They are a friendly and
welcoming way to learn more about contributing and how Flux is organised
as a project.

The next dates are going to be:

- [2022-06-01 12:00 UTC, 14:00
  CEST](https://www.meetup.com/Weave-User-Group/events/qwbmssydcjbcb/)
- [2022-06-09 17:00 UTC, 1pm
  ET](https://www.meetup.com/Weave-User-Group/events/zzbmssydcjbmb/)
- [2022-06-15 12:00 UTC, 14:00
  CEST](https://www.meetup.com/Weave-User-Group/events/qwbmssydcjbtb/) -
  Host: Sunny
- [2022-06-23 17:00 UTC, 1pm
  ET](https://www.meetup.com/Weave-User-Group/events/zzbmssydcjbfc/)
- [2022-06-29 12:00 UTC, 14:00
  CEST](https://www.meetup.com/Weave-User-Group/events/qwbmssydcjbmc/)

We are flexible with subjects and often go with the interests of the
group or of the presenter. If you want to come and join us in either
capacity, just show up or if you have questions, reach out to Kingdon on
Slack.

We really enjoyed this [demo of the k3d git
server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNt3v0kk6ec)
recently. It's a local Git server that runs outside of Kubernetes, to
support offline dev in a realistic but also simple way that does not
depend on GitHub or other hosted services.

## Flux Project Facts

We are very proud of what we have put together. We want to reiterate
some Flux facts - they are sort of our mission statement with Flux.

1. 🤝 Flux provides GitOps for both apps or
  infrastructure. Flux and Flagger deploy apps with
  canaries, feature flags, and A/B rollouts. Flux can also manage
  any Kubernetes resource. Infrastructure and workload dependency
  management is built-in.
1. 🤖 Just push to Git and Flux does the rest. Flux
  enables application deployment (CD) and (with the help of Flagger)
  progressive delivery (PD) through automatic reconciliation. Flux
  can even push back to Git for you with automated container image
  updates to Git (image scanning and patching).
1. 🔩 Flux works with your existing tools: Flux works with
  your Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, can even use
  s3-compatible buckets as a source), all major container
  registries, and all CI workflow providers.
1. 🔒 Flux is designed with security in mind: Pull vs. Push,
  least amount of privileges, adherence to Kubernetes security
  policies and tight integration with security tools and
  best-practices. Read more about our security considerations.
1. ☸️ Flux works with any Kubernetes and all common Kubernetes
  tooling: Kustomize, Helm, RBAC, and policy-driven
  validation (OPA, Kyverno, admission controllers) so it simply
  falls into place.
1. 🤹 Flux does Multi-Tenancy (and "Multi-everything"):
  Flux uses true Kubernetes RBAC via impersonation and supports
  multiple Git repositories. Multi-cluster infrastructure and apps
  work out of the box with Cluster API: Flux can use one Kubernetes
  cluster to manage apps in either the same or other clusters, spin
  up additional clusters themselves, and manage clusters including
  lifecycle and fleets.
1. 📞 Flux alerts and notifies: Flux provides health
  assessments, alerting to external systems and external events
  handling. Just "git push", and get notified on Slack and [other
  chat
  systems](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/main/docs/spec/v1beta1/provider.md).
1. 👍 Users trust Flux: Flux is a CNCF Incubating project
  and was categorised as \"Adopt\" on the [CNCF CI/CD Tech
  Radar](https://radar.cncf.io/2020-06-continuous-delivery)
  (alongside Helm).
1. 💖 Flux has a lovely community that is very easy to work
  with! We welcome contributors of any kind. The
  components of Flux are on Kubernetes core controller-runtime, so
  anyone can contribute and its functionality can be extended very
  easily.
