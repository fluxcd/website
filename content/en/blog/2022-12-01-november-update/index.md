As the Flux family of projects and its communities are growing, we
strive to inform you each month about what has already landed, new
possibilities which are available for integration, and where you can get
involved. Read [our last update here](/blog/2022/11/october-2022-update/).

It's the beginning of December 2022 - let's recap together what
happened in November - it has been a lot!

## News in the Flux family

### Flux has graduated

![Flux is CNCF Graduated project](flux-graduation-featured.png)

It's been quite the journey, and it wouldn't have been possible without
everybody's help in our community. We made it! Flux is now officially a
CNCF Graduated project. Here are some news pieces you might want to check

### Next Flux release brings consolidated Git implementation

The Flux development team keeps on innovating. The latest release is
[Flux v0.37](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.37.0) and as
always we encourage you all to upgrade for the best experience.

The biggest change is that the `gitImplementation` field of `GitRepository`
by source-controller and image-automation-controller is now deprecated.
Flux will effectively always use `go-git`. This now supports all Git
servers, including Azure DevOps and AWS CodeCommit, which previously were
only supported by `libgit2`. This is a big improvement and will help us focus
on making Flux work great with just one git implementation.

Here is our shortlist of features and improvements in the release:

- Support for bootstrapping Azure DevOps and AWS CodeCommit repositories
  using `flux bootstrap git`.
- Support cloning of Git v2 protocol (Azure DevOps and AWS CodeCommit) for
  `go-git` Git provider.
- Support force-pushing `ImageUpdateAutomation` repositories.
- Allow a dry-run of `flux build kustomization` with `--dry-run` and
  `--kustomization-file ./path/to/local/my-app.yaml`. Using these flags,
  variable substitutions from Secrets and ConfigMaps are skipped, and no
  connection to the cluster is made.
- Use signed OCI Helm chart for
  [kube-prometheus-stack](/flux/guides/monitoring/).

Check out these new pieces of documentation:

- Guide: [AWS CodeCommit bootstrap](/flux/use-cases/aws-codecommit/)
- Guide: [Azure DevOps
  bootstrap](/flux/use-cases/azure/#flux-installation-for-azure-devops)

💖 Big thanks to all the Flux contributors that helped us with this
release!

### Flux Roadmap Updates

Here's an update from the [Flux roadmap](/roadmap) - we are rushing
forward towards GA!

Starting with release v0.37, we started solidifying all required changes
for the Bootstrap GA milestone targeted to Q1 2023. That release should
include all major changes from a Git perspective that we want to ship
for GA. Please make sure you upgrade as soon as possible and provide us
with feedback, so we can work on it before the GA release.

Upcoming in the next release is a new feature for Image Automation
Controller: `GitShallowClones`. You can already check it out in the
recently published release candidate. If you are interested, you can
reach out via the PR or on Slack:
<https://github.com/fluxcd/image-automation-controller/pull/463>

### Security news

To benefit from our strong OCI integration, you might want to take a
look at our latest blog post about [how to verify the integrity of
Helm charts stored as OCI
artifacts](/blog/2022/11/verify-the-integrity-of-the-helm-charts-stored-as-oci-artifacts-before-reconciling-them-with-flux/).

To help you tighten security, the Kubernetes community has released
the [security-profiles-operator
project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator).
We are very pleased that it now comes with an [AppArmor profile for
Flux](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator/blob/main/examples/apparmorprofile-flux-controllers.yaml).

### Flagger 1.25 and 1.26 update to newest Gateway API

[Flagger 1.26.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger/releases/tag/v1.26.0)
comes with support Kubernetes [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
`v1beta1`. For more details see the [Gateway API Progressive Delivery
tutorial](https://docs.flagger.app/tutorials/gatewayapi-progressive-delivery).
Please note that starting with this version, the Gateway API v1alpha2 is
considered deprecated and will be removed from Flagger after 6 months.

[Flagger 1.25.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger/releases/tag/v1.25.0)
introduces a new deployment strategy combining Canary releases with
session affinity for Istio. Furthermore, it contains a regression fix
regarding metadata in alerts introduced in
[#1275](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger/pull/1275).

### Flux Ecosystem

<!--

If you add entries to this subsection, please don't use "we" as it gets
confusing from which perspective the whole blog post is written and who
"we" is. The whole post is meant to be from the perspective of the Flux
community. Better to write:]

- "Since the new release of X, it supports Y." or
- "Team lead X says: 'we have put a lot of effort into Y and are
   really proud of the performance results' ..." or
- "The team has been working on ..."

-->

#### Flux Subsystem for Argo

The team upgraded [Flux Subsystem for
Argo](https://github.com/flux-subsystem-argo/flamingo) aka Flamingo to
support Flux v0.37 and Argo CD v2.5.3, v2.4.17, v2.3.11 and v2.2.16.

#### Terraform-controller

The team has released [Weave
TF-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller) v0.13.1 and
recently updated its Helm chart to v0.9.3. In this version, the team
started shipping the AWS Package for TF-controller. The AWS Package is
an OCI Image which contains a set of Terraform primitive modules that you
can use out-of-the-box to provision your Terraform resources by describing
them as YAML.Please visit the package repository for more information:
<https://github.com/tf-controller/aws-primitive-modules>.

#### Weave GitOps

<https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops/releases/tag/v0.10.2>

### Upcoming Events 📆

We are happy to announce that we have a number of events coming up in
December- tune in to learn more about Flux and GitOps best practices,
get to know the team and join our community.

- [Dec 13: Implementing Flux for Scale with Soft
Multi-tenancy](https://www.meetup.com/weave-user-group/events/289768509)

The Flux project continues in active development with the addition of
OCI configuration planned in the GA roadmap.
Another Flux advancement has been the creation of the new VSCode
Extension which provides a convenient interface to Flux that can help
reduce friction moving between editor and terminal, alleviating the
headache of context switching overloading developer focus.

Flux maintainer Kingdon Barrett will demonstrate the pre-release of
Flux's new OCI features and a convenient way to access them while they
remain in pre-release so you can provide the feedback that is needed by
Flux maintainers to make this feature a success!

### Flux Bug Scrub

Our Flux Bug Scrubs still are happening on a weekly basis and remain one
of the best ways to get involved in Flux. They are a friendly and
welcoming way to learn more about contributing and how Flux is organised
as a project.

The next dates are going to be:

- [2022-12-08 12:00 UTC, 18:00
   UTC](https://www.meetup.com/weave-user-group/events/290045754/)

We are flexible with subjects and often go with the interests of the
group or of the presenter. If you want to come and join us in either
capacity, just show up or if you have questions, reach out to Kingdon on
Slack.

We really enjoyed this [demo of the k3d git
server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNt3v0kk6ec)
recently. It's a local Git server that runs outside of Kubernetes, to
support offline dev in a realistic but also simple way that does not
depend on GitHub or other hosted services.

## Flux Project Facts

We are very proud of what we have put together. We want to reiterate
some Flux facts - they are sort of our mission statement with Flux.

1. 🤝 Flux provides GitOps for both apps or
  infrastructure. Flux and Flagger deploy apps with
  canaries, feature flags, and A/B rollouts. Flux can also manage
  any Kubernetes resource. Infrastructure and workload dependency
  management is built-in.
1. 🤖 Just push to Git and Flux does the rest. Flux
  enables application deployment (CD) and (with the help of Flagger)
  progressive delivery (PD) through automatic reconciliation. Flux
  can even push back to Git for you with automated container image
  updates to Git (image scanning and patching).
1. 🔩 Flux works with your existing tools: Flux works with
  your Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, can even use
  s3-compatible buckets as a source), all major container
  registries, and all CI workflow providers.
1. 🔒 Flux is designed with security in mind: Pull vs. Push,
  least amount of privileges, adherence to Kubernetes security
  policies and tight integration with security tools and
  best-practices. Read more about our security considerations.
1. ☸️ Flux works with any Kubernetes and all common Kubernetes
  tooling: Kustomize, Helm, RBAC, and policy-driven
  validation (OPA, Kyverno, admission controllers) so it simply
  falls into place.
1. 🤹 Flux does Multi-Tenancy (and "Multi-everything"):
  Flux uses true Kubernetes RBAC via impersonation and supports
  multiple Git repositories. Multi-cluster infrastructure and apps
  work out of the box with Cluster API: Flux can use one Kubernetes
  cluster to manage apps in either the same or other clusters, spin
  up additional clusters themselves, and manage clusters including
  lifecycle and fleets.
1. 📞 Flux alerts and notifies: Flux provides health
  assessments, alerting to external systems and external events
  handling. Just "git push", and get notified on Slack and [other
  chat
  systems](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/main/docs/spec/v1beta1/provider.md).
1. 👍 Users trust Flux: Flux is a CNCF Graduated project
  and was categorised as "Adopt" on the [CNCF CI/CD Tech
  Radar](https://radar.cncf.io/2020-06-continuous-delivery)
  (alongside Helm).
1. 💖 Flux has a lovely community that is very easy to work
  with! We welcome contributors of any kind. The
  components of Flux are on Kubernetes core controller-runtime, so
  anyone can contribute and its functionality can be extended very
  easily.
