As the Flux family of projects and its communities are growing, we
strive to inform you each month about what has already landed, new
possibilities which are available for integration, and where you can get
involved. Read our last update [here](/blog/2023/05/april-2023-update/).

It's the beginning of June 2023 - let's recap together what
happened in May - it has been a lot!

## News in the Flux family

### Flux 2.0.0RC2 released: many improvements - please test

On our path to GA, we released v2.0.0-rc2, the second release candidate for
the 2.0.0 release. It includes many fixes, so you are very much encouraged to
upgrade to this latest version - even though it carries "RC" in its version
number, it is the most stable Flux release to date. Users are advised to
upgrade from v0.41 and older versions to v2.0.0-rc.2 as soon as possible.

Fixes and improvements

- Starting with this version, source-controller, kustomize-controller and
  helm-controller pods are marked as
  [system-cluster-critical](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/).
- Fix bootstrap for BitBucket Server (CLI).
- Fix secrets decryption when using Azure Key Vault (kustomize-controller).
- Fix drift detection for renamed HelmReleases (helm-controller).
- Improve performance when handling webhook receivers (notification-controller).
- The `Alert` v1beta2 API has a new optional field `.spec.inclusionList` for
  fine-grained control over events filtering (notification-controller).
- The deprecated field `.status.url` was removed from the `Receiver` v1
  API (notification-controller).
- Add support for commit signing using OpenPGP keys with
  passphrases (image-automation-controller).

To upgrade from v0.x to v2.0.0-rc.2 please follow the same produce published in
the [RC.1 release notes](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1).

Note that Kubernetes 1.27.0 contains a regression bug that affects Flux, it is
recommended to upgrade Kubernetes to 1.27.1.

Big thanks to all the Flux contributors that helped us with this release!

<!--

If you add entries to this subsection, please don't use "we" as it gets
confusing from which perspective the whole blog post is written and who
"we" is. The whole post is meant to be from the perspective of the Flux
community. Better to write:]

- "Since the new release of X, it supports Y." or
- "Team lead X says: 'we have put a lot of effort into Y and are
   really proud of the performance results' ..." or
- "The team has been working on ..."

## Recent & Upcoming Events

It's important to keep you up to date with new features and developments
in Flux and provide simple ways to see our work in action and chat with
our engineers.

### GitOpsCon North America 2023

### Open Source Summit 2023

### Recent Events (ICYMI) üì∫

We feel blessed to have such a big community of users, contributors and
integrators and so many are happy to talk about their experiences. In
May here are a couple of talks we would like to highlight.

...

Here is a list of additional videos and topics we really enjoyed -
please let us know if we missed anything of interest and we will make
sure to mention it in the next post!

...

### Upcoming Events üìÜ

We are happy to announce that we have a number of events coming up in
April- tune in to learn more about Flux and GitOps best practices,
get to know the team and join our community.

#### Flux Bug Scrub

Our Flux Bug Scrubs still are happening on a weekly basis and remain one
of the best ways to get involved in Flux. They are a friendly and
welcoming way to learn more about contributing and how Flux is organised
as a project.

The next dates are going to be:

- [2023-06-yy 12:00 UTC, 14:00 CEST](/#calendar)
- [2023-06-yy 17:00 UTC, 19:00 CEST](/#calendar)
- [2023-06-yy 12:00 UTC, 14:00 CEST](/#calendar)
- [2023-06-yy 17:00 UTC, 19:00 CEST](/#calendar)

We are flexible with subjects and often go with the interests of the
group or of the presenter. If you want to come and join us in either
capacity, just show up or if you have questions, reach out to Kingdon on
Slack.

We really enjoyed this [demo of the k3d git
server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNt3v0kk6ec)
recently. It's a local Git server that runs outside of Kubernetes, to
support offline dev in a realistic but also simple way that does not
depend on GitHub or other hosted services.

## In other news

## Flux Project Facts

We are very proud of what we have put together. We want to reiterate
some Flux facts - they are sort of our mission statement with Flux.

1. ü§ù Flux provides GitOps for both apps or
  infrastructure. Flux and [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger)
  deploy apps with canaries, feature flags, and A/B rollouts. Flux
  can also manage any Kubernetes resource. Infrastructure and workload
  dependency management is built-in.
1. ü§ñ Just push to Git and Flux does the rest. Flux
  enables application deployment (CD) and (with the help of
  [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger))
  progressive delivery (PD) through automatic reconciliation. Flux
  can even push back to Git for you with automated container image
  updates to Git (image scanning and patching).
1. üî© Flux works with your existing tools: Flux works with your Git
   providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, can even use s3-compatible
   buckets as a source), all major container registries, fully
   integrates [with OCI](/flux/cheatsheets/oci-artifacts) and all CI
   workflow providers.
1. üîí Flux is designed with security in mind: Pull vs. Push,
  least amount of privileges, adherence to Kubernetes security
  policies and tight integration with security tools and
  best-practices. Read more about our security considerations.
1. ‚ò∏Ô∏è Flux works with any Kubernetes and all common Kubernetes
  tooling: Kustomize, Helm, RBAC, and policy-driven
  validation (OPA, Kyverno, admission controllers) so it simply
  falls into place.
1. ü§π Flux does Multi-Tenancy (and "Multi-everything"):
  Flux uses true Kubernetes RBAC via impersonation and supports
  multiple Git repositories. Multi-cluster infrastructure and apps
  work out of the box with Cluster API: Flux can use one Kubernetes
  cluster to manage apps in either the same or other clusters, spin
  up additional clusters themselves, and manage clusters including
  lifecycle and fleets.
1. ‚ú® Dashboards love Flux: No matter if you use one of
   [the Flux UIs](/ecosystem/#flux-uis--guis) or a hosted cloud
   offering from your cloud vendor, Flux has a thriving ecosystem
   of integrations and products built on top of it and all have
   great dashboards for you.
1. üìû Flux alerts and notifies: Flux provides health
  assessments, alerting to external systems and external events
  handling. Just "git push", and get notified on Slack and [other
  chat systems](/flux/components/notification/provider/).
1. üëç Users trust Flux: Flux is a CNCF Graduated project
  and was categorised as "Adopt" on the [CNCF CI/CD Tech
  Radar](https://radar.cncf.io/2020-06-continuous-delivery)
  (alongside Helm).
1. üíñ Flux has a lovely community that is very easy to work
  with! We welcome contributors of any kind. The
  components of Flux are on Kubernetes core controller-runtime, so
  anyone can contribute and its functionality can be extended very
  easily.
