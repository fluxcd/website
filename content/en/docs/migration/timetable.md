[^1]: GOTK is shorthand for the [GitOps Toolkit](/docs/components/) APIs and Controllers

[^2]: Versioning: Flux 2 is a multi-service architecture, so requires a more complex explanation than Flux 1:
     - Flux 2 CLI follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme
     - The GitOps Toolkit APIs follow the [Kubernetes API versioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning) pattern. See [Roadmap](/roadmap/) for component versions.
     - These are coordinated for cross-compatibility: For each Flux 2 CLI tag, CLI and GOTK versions are end-to-end tested together, so you may safely upgrade from one MINOR/PATCH version to another.

[^3]: The GOTK Custom Resource Definitions which are at `v1beta1` and `v2beta1` and their controllers are considered stable and production ready. Going forward, breaking changes to the beta CRDs will be accompanied by a conversion mechanism.
