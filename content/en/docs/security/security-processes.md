## Security Process

### Report a Vulnerability

We're very thankful for ‚Äì and if desired happy to credit ‚Äì¬†security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to the Flux community.

- To make a report please email the private security list at <cncf-flux-security@lists.cncf.io> with the details.
  We ask that reporters act in good faith by not disclosing the issue to others.
- You may, but are not required to, encrypt your email to this list using the PGP keys of Security Team members, listed below.
- The Security Team will fix the issue as soon as possible and coordinate a release date with you.
- You will be able to choose if you want public acknowledgement of your effort and how you would like to be credited.

### Security Team

### Handling

- All reports are thoroughly investigated by the Security Team.
- Any vulnerability information shared with the Security Team will not be shared with others unless it is necessary to fix the issue.
  Information is shared only on a need to know basis.
- As the security issue moves through the identification and resolution process, the reporter will be notified.
- Additional questions about the vulnerability may also be asked of the reporter.

### Disclosures

Vulnerability disclosures are emailed to the Flux Dev mailing list <https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-flux-dev> and announced publicly.
Disclosures will contain an overview, details about the vulnerability, a fix that will typically be an update, and optionally a workaround if one is available.

We will coordinate publishing disclosures and security releases in a way that is realistic and necessary for end users.
We prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available.
Disclosures will always be published in a timely manner after a release is published that fixes the vulnerability.
