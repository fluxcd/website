      <i>Leveraging GitOps has allowed us to create a self-service platform for engineers so they can concentrate on delivering business value through innovation, without the full need for Platform Team assistance. The engineers focus on building container images and managing the testing of their microservices and Weave Flux handles the deployments.</i>

        </div>
        <div class="details">
          In this talk we will share what early mistakes we made adopting GitOps, explain how FluxCD v2 helped us with solving many of those problems and show you how does our current solution looks like. We will also go into detail what benefits we have harvested with GitOps in contrast to other models and which pain points GitOps helped us eliminate/avoid. Finally, we will elaborate our way forward into the rough sea of 100s of clusters.

      <i>By introducing Helm and Flux, DoD moved to a more declarative model where everything is version controlled and deployed by Flux thereby reducing manual operations, improving deployment consistency and also bringing more compliance with regard to change management and application life cycle.</i>
