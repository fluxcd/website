Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of
configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to
configuration when there is new code to deploy.

Flux is built from the ground up to use Kubernetes'
API extension system, and to integrate with Prometheus and other core
components of the Kubernetes ecosystem. Flux supports
multi-tenancy and support for syncing an arbitrary number of Git
repositories.

## Flux in Short

<!-- borrowed from ./content/en/_index.html -->

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ü§ù Flux provides GitOps for both apps and infrastructure | Flux and [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger) deploy apps with canaries, feature flags, and A/B rollouts. Flux can also manage any Kubernetes resource. Infrastructure and workload dependency management is built in. |
| ü§ñ Just push to Git and Flux does the rest | Flux enables application deployment (CD) and (with the help of [Flagger](https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger)) progressive delivery (PD) through automatic reconciliation. Flux can even push back to Git for you with automated container image updates to Git (image scanning and patching). |
| üî© Flux works with your existing tools | Flux works with your Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, can even use s3-compatible buckets as a source), all major container registries, fully integrates [with OCI](/flux/cheatsheets/oci-artifacts) and all CI workflow providers. |
| üîí Flux is designed with security in mind | Pull vs. Push, least amount of privileges, adherence to Kubernetes security policies and tight integration with security tools and best-practices. Read more about [our security considerations](/flux/security). |
| ‚ò∏Ô∏è Flux works with any Kubernetes and all common Kubernetes tooling |  Kustomize, Helm, RBAC, and policy-driven validation (OPA, Kyverno, admission controllers) so it simply falls into place. |
| ü§π Flux does Multi-Tenancy (and ‚ÄúMulti-everything‚Äù) | Flux uses true Kubernetes RBAC via impersonation and supports multiple Git repositories. Multi-cluster infrastructure and apps work out of the box with Cluster API: Flux can use one Kubernetes cluster to manage apps in either the same or other clusters, spin up additional clusters themselves, and manage clusters including lifecycle and fleets. |
| ‚ú® Dashboards love Flux | No matter if you use one of [the Flux UIs](/ecosystem/#flux-uis--guis) or a hosted cloud offering from your cloud vendor, Flux has a thriving ecosystem of integrations and products built on top of it and all have great dashboards for you. |
| üìû Flux alerts and notifies | Flux provides health assessments, alerting to external systems, and external events handling. Just ‚Äúgit push‚Äù, and get notified on Slack and [other chat systems](/flux/components/notification/provider/). |
| üëç Users trust Flux | Flux is a CNCF Graduated project and was categorised as "Adopt" on the [CNCF CI/CD Tech Radar](https://radar.cncf.io/2020-06-continuous-delivery) (alongside Helm). |
| üíñ Flux has a lovely community that is very easy to work with! | We welcome contributors of any kind. The components of Flux are on Kubernetes core `controller-runtime`, so anyone can contribute and its functionality can be extended very easily. |

## Who is Flux for?

Flux helps

- **cluster operators** who automate provision and configuration of clusters;
- **platform engineers** who build continuous delivery for developer teams;
- **app developers** who rely on continuous delivery to get their code live.

## What can I do with Flux?

Flux is based on a set of Kubernetes API extensions ("custom
resources"), which control how git repositories and other sources of
configuration are applied into the cluster ("synced").
For example, you create a `GitRepository` object to mirror
configuration from a Git repository, then a `Kustomization` object to
sync that configuration.

Flux works with Kubernetes' role-based access control (RBAC), so you
can lock down what any particular sync can change. It can send
notifications to Slack and other like systems when configuration is
synced and ready, and receive webhooks to tell it when to sync.

The `flux` command-line tool is a convenient way to bootstrap the
system in a cluster, and to access the custom resources that make up
the API.

## Where do I start?

{{% alert title="Get started with Flux!" %}}
Following this [guide](get-started/) will just take a couple of minutes to complete:
After installing the `flux` CLI and running a couple of very simple commands,
you will have a GitOps workflow setup which involves a staging and a production cluster.

- Integration with Kubernetes RBAC
- Health assessment (clusters and workloads)
- Dependency management (infrastructure and workloads)

## What is the GitOps Toolkit?

Flux is constructed with the [GitOps Toolkit components](components/), which is a set of

- specialized tools and Flux Controllers
- composable APIs
- reusable Go packages for GitOps under the [fluxcd GitHub organisation](https://github.com/fluxcd)

for building Continuous Delivery on top of Kubernetes.

The [GitOps Toolkit](components/) can be used individually by **platform
engineers** who want to make their own continuous delivery system, and
have requirements not covered by Flux.
