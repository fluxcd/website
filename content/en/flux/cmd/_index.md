## Install using Bash

To install the latest release on Linux, macOS or Windows WSL:

```bash
curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The [install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluxcd/flux2/main/install/flux.sh) does the following:
* attempts to detect your OS
* downloads, verifies and unpacks the release tar file in a temporary directory
* copies the `flux` binary to `/usr/local/bin`
* removes the temporary directory

You can also install to a custom directory (e.g., `~/.local/bin`):

```bash
curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | bash -s ~/.local/bin
```

Please make sure that this directory is part of your `$PATH` environment variable.

To install a specific version, you can set the `FLUX_VERSION` environment variable (e.g., `2.7.0`):

```bash
curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | FLUX_VERSION=2.7.0 bash -s ~/.local/bin
```

## Install using Docker

A container image with `kubectl` and `flux` is available on DockerHub and GitHub:

* `docker.io/fluxcd/flux-cli:<version>`
* `ghcr.io/fluxcd/flux-cli:<version>`

Example usage:

```console
$ docker run -it --entrypoint=sh -v ~/.kube/config:/kubeconfig ghcr.io/fluxcd/flux-cli:v2.7.0
/ # flux check --kubeconfig=kubeconfig
```

## Enable shell autocompletion

To configure your shell to load `flux` [bash completions](flux_completion_bash.md) add to your profile:

```sh
. <(flux completion bash)
```

[`zsh`](flux_completion_zsh.md), [`fish`](flux_completion_fish.md),
and [`powershell`](flux_completion_powershell.md)
are also supported with their own sub-commands.
