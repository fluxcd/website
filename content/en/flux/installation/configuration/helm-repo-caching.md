The source-controller component in Flux fetches index files from remote Helm repositories to fetch information. 
For large repositories, this process can consume a significant amount of memory.

Helm repositories caching helps Flux's source-controller to store and reuse data from remote Helm repositories, 
reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data and conserving memory resources.

To enable caching and reduce the memory footprint of source-controller for large Helm repository index files [during bootstrap](_index.md), add the following patches to the flux-system `kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - gotk-components.yaml
  - gotk-sync.yaml
patches:
  - patch: |
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --helm-cache-max-size=10
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --helm-cache-ttl=60m
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --helm-cache-purge-interval=5m
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: source-controller
```

When `helm-cache-max-size` is reached, an error is logged and the index is instead
read from file. Cache hits are exposed via the `gotk_cache_events_total` Prometheus
metrics. Use this data to fine-tune the configuration flags.
