When Flux is managing hundreds of applications that are deployed multiple times per day, cluster admins
can fine tune the Flux controller at [bootstrap time](boostrap-customization.md) to run at scale by:

- [Increasing the number of workers and resource limits](#increase-the-number-of-workers-and-limits)
- [Enabling Helm repository caching to reduce memory usage](#enable-helm-repositories-caching)
- [Enabling persistent storage for internal artifacts](#persistent-storage-for-flux-internal-artifacts)
- [Running the Flux controllers on dedicated nodes](#node-affinity-and-tolerations)

{{% alert color="info" title="Horizontal scaling" %}}
When vertical scaling is not an option, you can use sharding to horizontally scale
the Flux controllers. For more details please see the [sharding guide](sharding.md).

## Increase the number of workers and limits

If Flux is managing hundreds of applications, it is advised to increase the number of reconciliations
that can be performed in parallel and to bump the resources limits:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - gotk-components.yaml
  - gotk-sync.yaml
patches:
  - patch: |
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --concurrent=20
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --requeue-dependency=5s
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: "(kustomize-controller|helm-controller|source-controller)"
  - patch: |
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: all
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: manager
                resources:
                  limits:
                    cpu: 2000m
                    memory: 2Gi
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: "(kustomize-controller|helm-controller|source-controller)"
```

## Enable Helm repositories caching

If Flux connects to Helm repositories hosting hundreds of Helm charts,
it is advised to enable caching to reduce the memory footprint of source-controller:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - gotk-components.yaml
  - gotk-sync.yaml
patches:
  - patch: |
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --helm-cache-max-size=10
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --helm-cache-ttl=60m
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --helm-cache-purge-interval=5m
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: source-controller
```

When `helm-cache-max-size` is reached, an error is logged and the index is instead
read from file. Cache hits are exposed via the `gotk_cache_events_total` Prometheus
metrics. Use this data to fine-tune the configuration flags.


## Persistent storage for Flux internal artifacts

Flux maintains a local cache of artifacts acquired from external sources.
By default, the cache is stored in an `EmptyDir` volume, which means that after a restart,
Flux has to restore the local cache by fetching the content of all Git
repositories, Buckets, Helm charts and OCI artifacts. To avoid losing the cached artifacts,
you can configure source-controller with a persistent volume.

Create a Kubernetes PVC definition named `gotk-pvc.yaml` and place it in your `flux-system` directory:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: gotk-pvc
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: standard
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

Add the PVC file to the `kustomization.yaml` resources and patch the source-controller volumes:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - gotk-components.yaml
  - gotk-sync.yaml
  - gotk-pvc.yaml
patches:
  - patch: |
      - op: add
        path: '/spec/template/spec/volumes/-'
        value:
          name: persistent-data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: gotk-pvc
      - op: replace
        path: '/spec/template/spec/containers/0/volumeMounts/0'
        value:
          name: persistent-data
          mountPath: /data
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: source-controller
```

## Node affinity and tolerations

Pin the Flux controller pods to specific nodes and allow the cluster autoscaler to evict them:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - gotk-components.yaml
  - gotk-sync.yaml
patches:
  - patch: |
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: all
      spec:
        template:
          metadata:
            annotations:
              cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "true"
          spec:
            affinity:
              nodeAffinity:
                requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                  nodeSelectorTerms:
                    - matchExpressions:
                        - key: role
                          operator: In
                          values:
                            - flux
            tolerations:
              - effect: NoSchedule
                key: role
                operator: Equal
                value: flux
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      labelSelector: app.kubernetes.io/part-of=flux
```

The above configuration pins Flux to nodes tainted and labeled with:

```sh
kubectl taint nodes <my-node> role=flux:NoSchedule
kubectl label nodes <my-node> role=flux
```
