# Flux Roadmap

{{% alert color="info" title="Production readiness" %}}
The Flux latest [beta and stable APIs](/flux/components/)
(including their reconcilers) are well tested and safe to use in production environments.

The beta APIs will be replaced in time with stable versions. After an API reaches GA,
users have a six months window to upgrade the Flux CRDs and their Custom Resources
from beta to stable.

## Milestones

The GA roadmap has been split into separate milestones.
The Flux team's current focus is to finalise the tasks from the [Flux GitOps GA](#flux-gitops-ga-q1-2023) milestone.
We estimate that the Flux features part of this milestone will become generally available in the first quarter of 2023.

### Flux GitOps GA (Completed in July 2023)

The goal of this milestone is to make a generally available release for the Flux GitOps APIs,
and the Flux Git bootstrap & webhooks functionalities.

The completion of this milestone is marked by the [v2.0.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0) release of the Flux distribution and CLI.
