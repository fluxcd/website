To configure your shell to load `flux` [bash completions](./cmd/flux_completion_bash.md) add to your profile:

```sh
. <(flux completion bash)
```
[`zsh`](./cmd/flux_completion_zsh.md), [`fish`](./cmd/flux_completion_fish.md),
and [`powershell`](./cmd/flux_completion_powershell.md)
are also supported with their own sub-commands.
